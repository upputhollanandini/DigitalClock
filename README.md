# DigitalClock
This repository features a basic digital clock written in C. It uses standard C libraries and system calls to display real-time on the console, updating every second. The program clears the console screen before displaying the updated time, ensuring a neat appearance. It handles time rollover seamlessly for uninterrupted operation.
